									<p>"Lisa has been walking my dog, Lola, for over four years now. She is always reliable and Lola always looks forward to seeing her everyday, it gives me piece of mind that she is so well looked after."</p>

								<div class="item">
									<p>"Choose Lisa because she is the best dog walker in Essex! She is kind yet firm she comes in all weathers and is trustworthy, the dogs love her! My dog Toffee does and has had her walks with Lisa for 5 Years, I dont know what I would do without her!"</p>

									<p>"Thanks for all your help! I thought Rosie’s memory wasn’t good but changed my mind when I got lost on the estate! I just let Rosie go where she wanted smelling all the way, and ended up at the park! Of course she knows where she is going!! Keep up the good work Lisa!"</p>

									<p>"It has been a year since Edward came into my life and subsequently I found you to look after him when I go off on my travels. I wanted to take this opportunity to say Thank You so much for looking after him on many occasions. He always seems very content when I return as if he's not missed me much at all! It is a comfort knowing that he's in safe hands and is being looked after in his own surroundings. It's also a relief to know that the house is being looked after too. You've always managed to accommodate all my travel dates to which I am truly thankful and know that I can rely on you. Thank you so much once again; I don't know what I'd do without you."</p>

									<p>"I have used Walkies Pet Care Service for over two year to walk my show dogs each week and still going. Being a judge and a steward at the top shows Crufts etc my self. I fully recommend with experience found with this service to all various breeds’ owners and show owners. Lisa Read is a highly professional handler; understand dog problems and knowledge of various breeds’ behaviour requirements via walks. She is most reliable and takes a great pride in her line of work with good communications skills with owners and their dogs. A happy dog has a happy owner coming home from work with greetings."</p>

									<p>"Lisa is a very reliable dog walker. She has a key to our house, as always been very trustworthy. Lisa walks my dogs 3 times a week rain, shine or even snow (bless her). My dogs know their routine, on the mornings Lisa is due they are waiting by the door very excited. When they come back from a walk they are always ready for a sleep Lisa is a kind and lovely person to both dogs and people we would highly recommend her."</p>
								</div>
								<div class="item">
									<p>"Lisa walked our dog Stanley every weekday for 3 years from when he was a puppy and loved him like he was her own.  Knowing that she would be there for him within hours each morning eased the heartache of leaving him each day to go to work.  She was always reliable and never once let us down.  The only complaint I have is that Stanley loved her a bit too much and I was jealous when I watched how he bounded towards her without looking back on the days when I was around!"</p>
